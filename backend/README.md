# Node.js Project

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system. You can download them from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation
1. Initialize the project:
   ```bash
   npm init
   ```
   Follow the prompts to set up your `package.json` file. You can accept the defaults or customize them as needed.

2. Install any required dependencies for your project:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Project
To start your project, run the following command:
```bash
npm start
```
Make sure the `start` script is defined in your `package.json`. For example:
```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "node index.js"
}
```
Replace `index.js` with the entry point of your application if it's named differently.

### Additional Notes
- If you encounter any errors, ensure all dependencies are correctly installed.
- Use version control (e.g., Git) to track changes in your project files.

## License
Specify your project's license (e.g., MIT, Apache-2.0).
